The founding contributors pre mined JBX tokens to backpay the contributions made. The valuation of each token was the same as it is now during the first funding cycle.

- **Jango** got **$125k** for developing and testing the smart contracts.
- **Peripheralist** got **$125k** for writing juicebox.money.
- **AtomicMieos** got **$10k** for always being around to help shape ideas.
- **Sage** got **$7k** for design and illustration commissions.
- **Nervetrip** got **$3k** for helping to write an early prototype and do code reviews.
- **Austin Griffith** got **$3k** as a thank you for his work on Scaffold ETH, which Juicebox is built using.
- **Paul Razvan Berg** got **$3k** as a thank you for writing and testing solidity helper libraries that I used extensively. Especially for math operations on e18 numbers.
- **Teddy Wilson **got **$1k** for submitting a very useful PR that automates test routines.
- **Apoorv Lathey** got **$200** for a small PR he made to the repo when the code was just getting started.

The numbers are a bit arbitrary, but hopefully enough of you think its a fair start. If not, theres no shame is speaking up. We can always make changes to our reserved token allocation in upcoming funding cycles to rebalance pre mine compensation.
