The Juicebox contracts were deployed to Ethereum two days ago. Yesterday, [@peripheralist](https://twitter.com/peripheralist), who built the [juicebox.money](http://juicebox.money) website, launched a generative art project called Tiles using the Juicebox protocol as its treasury, [http://tiles.art](http://tiles.art). He started a DAO around it, [https://discord.gg/bgGwmjWJ85](https://discord.gg/bgGwmjWJ85). 

With Juicebox, we had built a business-model protocol. With Tiles, he built a beautiful, expressive, and flexible collection of generative art to rally a community around. Neither of us had much of an idea what would or should happen next, but I was excited to take a step back and find out.

My conclusion: From a growth perspective, we can either go out and look for more entrepreneurs and artists that could benefit from using Juicebox, or we can lean into TileDAO since it's the one project that currently uses Juicebox. Since `building stuff > shilling stuff` is an invariant for me, I think the best thing I can do right now as a $JBX token holder is to participate in TileDAO and help grow it. As other projects start considering building on Juicebox, our job will be to become supporting cast member of their community also.
