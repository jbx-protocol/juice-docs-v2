# Funding

**Funding** contains _Funding cycle duration_ and _Funding cycle target_.

To synchronize governance, payouts, and project reconfiguration, Juicebox projects can operate using "funding cycles". Project owners cannot change any project parameters during a funding cycle, and must instead queue them for upcoming cycles.&#x20;

Not having funding cycles allows a project owner to withdraw funds from a project at any time, and  to manually trigger new funding cycles whenever they want. Your treasury strategy (including contributor payouts and fixed monthly costs) should be considered when configuring _Funding cycle duration_ and _Funding cycle target_.

* _Funding cycle duration_ determines how long these funding cycles will last, and determines how often you can withdraw your target amount.
* _Funding cycle target_ is a per-cycle target amount. This is the amount that can be withdrawn from the Juicebox each funding cycle.

:::tip
Once the _Funding cycle target_ is met, any additional funds raised are considered **overflow**. If _Allow minting tokens_ is enabled (see [restricted-actions.md](restricted-actions.md "mention")), people who fund your project receive tokens which they can use to claim a portion of the overflow.
