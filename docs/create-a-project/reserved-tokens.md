# Reserved Tokens

Each payment to a Juicebox project generates **tokens** which can be used to claim a portion of the **overflow** (see [funding.md](funding.md "mention")). The **Reserved Tokens** section determines what percentage of these tokens goes to the payer and what percentage of these tokens goes to a designated list of Ethereum wallets and Juicebox projects.

* _Reserved tokens_ determines what percentage of token issuance is reserved.
* _Allocate reserved tokens_ determines how reserved tokens will be distributed. By default, reserved tokens go to the project owner.

:::tip
Once your project has been deployed, you can issue ERC-20 tokens on [juicebox.money](https://www.juicebox.money) which can be claimed by wallets that have already funded your project.
