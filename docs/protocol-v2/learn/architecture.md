# Architecture

The protocol is made up of 7 core contracts and 3 surface contracts.

* Core contracts store all the independent components that make the protocol work.
* Surface contracts glue core contracts together and manage funds. Anyone can write new surface contracts for projects to use.

## Core contracts

The first two core contracts are pretty self explanatory. They store the core opinionated components of the protocol.

* [`JBTokenStore`](../api/contracts/jbtokenstore/) manages token minting and burning for all projects.
* [`JBFundingCycleStore`](../api/contracts/jbfundingcyclestore/) manages funding cycle configurations and scheduling. Funding cycles are represented as a [`JBFundingCycle`](../api/data-structures/jbfundingcycle.md) data structure.

The next few are a little more generic. They don't know anything specific to the ecosystem, and are open for use by other protocols or future extensions.

*   [`JBProjects`](../api/contracts/jbprojects/) manages and tracks ownership over projects, which are represented as ERC-721 tokens.

    The protocol uses this to enforce permissions needed to access several project-oriented transactions.
*   [`JBSplitsStore`](../api/contracts/jbsplitsstore/) stores information about how arbitrary distributions should be split. The information is represented as a [`JBSplit`](../api/data-structures/jbsplit.md) data structure.

    The surface contracts currently use these to split up payout distributions and reserved token distributions.
*   [`JBPrices`](../api/contracts/jbprices/) manages and normalizes price feeds of various fiat currencies.

    The protocol uses this to allow projects to do their accounting in any number of fiat currencies, but manage all funds in ETH regardless of accounting choice.
*   [`JBOperatorStore`](../api/contracts/jboperatorstore/) stores operator permissions for all addresses. Addresses can give permissions to any other address to take specific indexed actions on their behalf, while confining the permissions to an arbitrary number of domains.

    The protocol uses this to allow project owners to give other EOAs or contracts permission to take certain administrative actions on their behalf. This is useful for encouraging a composable ecosystem where proxy contracts can perform actions on a project's behalf as a lego block.

The last core contract stores info about which surface contracts each project is currently using, mainly which payment terminals each project is currently accepting funds through, and which controller contract defines the rules according to which each project's terminal contract interacts with the core contracts.

* [`JBDirectory`](../api/contracts/jbdirectory/) keeps a reference of which terminal contracts each project is currently accepting funds through, and which controller contract is managing each project's tokens and funding cycles.

## Surface contracts

There are currently 3 surface contracts that manage how projects manage funds and define how all core contracts should be used together. Anyone can write new surface contracts for projects to use.

* [`JBController`](../api/contracts/or-controllers/jbcontroller/) stitches together funding cycles and community tokens, allowing for curated control, accounting, and token management.
* [`JBPayoutRedemptionPaymentTerminal`](../api/contracts/or-abstract/jbpayoutredemptionpaymentterminal/) manages all inflows and outflows of funds into the ecosystem. This is an abstract implementation that can be used by any number of payment terminals, such as [`JBETHPaymentTerminal`](../../api/contracts/or-payment-terminals/jbethpaymentterminal/)'s and [`JBERC20PaymentTerminal`](../../api/contracts/or-payment-terminals/jberc20paymentterminal/)'s.
* [`JBPaymentTerminalStore`](../api/contracts/jbpaymentterminalstore/) manages balance accounting data on payment terminals' behalf.

The abstract [`JBPayoutRedemptionPaymentTerminal`](../api/contracts/or-abstract/jbpayoutredemptionpaymentterminal/) implements the [`IJBPaymentTerminal`](../api/interfaces/ijbpaymentterminal.md) interface to provide outflow mechanics, and [`JBETHPaymentTerminal`](../../api/contracts/or-payment-terminals/jbethpaymentterminal/)'s and [`JBERC20PaymentTerminal`](../../api/contracts/or-payment-terminals/jberc20paymentterminal/)'s in-turn extend the [`JBPayoutRedemptionPaymentTerminal`](../api/contracts/or-abstract/jbpayoutredemptionpaymentterminal/) to provide scoped inflow/outflow environments for specific tokens. Projects are welcome to roll their own [`IJBPaymentTerminal`](../api/interfaces/ijbpaymentterminal.md) implementations to accept funds through. This can be useful to accept other tokens as payment, bypass protocol fees, or attempt some other funky design. A project can add/remove terminals from the core [`JBDirectory`](../api/contracts/jbdirectory/) contract using the [`JBDirectory.setTerminalsOf(...)`](../api/contracts/jbdirectory/write/setterminalsof.md) transaction.

Likewise, a project can bring their own contract to serve as its controller. A project's controller is the only contract that has direct access to manipulate its tokens and funding cycles. A project can set its controller from the core [`JBDirectory`](../api/contracts/jbdirectory/) contract using the [`JBDirectory.setControllerOf(...)`](../api/contracts/jbdirectory/write/setcontrollerof.md) transaction.
