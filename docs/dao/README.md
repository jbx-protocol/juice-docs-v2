# About JuiceboxDAO

#### *JuiceboxDAO helps people confidently run programmable and community funded treasuries from startup to scale, openly on Ethereum.*

JuiceboxDAO and its community build and maintain the Juicebox protocol, a framework for funding and operating projects openly on Ethereum. Its contracts allow communities to deploy an administrative NFT, programmable payment terminals for receiving and distributing funds, project tokens for community membership, and funding cycles for timelocked and recurring constraints—all in powerful, customizable ways. 

Juicebox treasuries can evolve over time, allowing people to launch open-ended projects and to adjust constraints, extensions, and incentives over time as needed. The protocol is light enough for a group of friends, yet powerful enough for a global network of anons sharing thousands of ETH, ERC-20s, or other assets.

JuiceboxDAO contributors build the protocol and ecosystem around it, enabling projects to raise thousands of ETH and build robust communities around their treasuries and tokens.
