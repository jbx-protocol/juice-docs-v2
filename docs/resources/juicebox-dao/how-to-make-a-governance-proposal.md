# How to Make a Governance Proposal

*Note: Juicebox DAO operates on a 14 day governance cycle which you can read about [here](governance-process.md). You can see where we are in the current cycle on the [Governance Cycle Calendar](https://www.notion.so/09936865803248e38c82adbc3ed32137).*

*The revision process can cause a proposal to take more than one funding cycle to reach the Juicebox snapshot. Honest and plain feedback in Discord proposal threads is encouraged.*

**In order to create a new proposal:**

1. Visit the [proposals database](https://www.notion.so/9d126f9148dc42ee83317d5cd74e4db4).
2. Click the ⬇ next to "New" (pictured below) and select `📜 Proposal Template`

3. Fill out the template by following the [Proposal Template Guide](proposal-template.md). Once you've answered each question to the best of your ability, change your proposal’s *status* (the first Notion field at the top of the document) from `Draft` to `Discussion`.
4. A discussion thread for your proposal will be generated in `#💡-proposals-workshop` channel of [Juicebox's Discord server](https://discord.gg/juicebox). From there, community members will help you to prepare the proposal for the next temperature check.
