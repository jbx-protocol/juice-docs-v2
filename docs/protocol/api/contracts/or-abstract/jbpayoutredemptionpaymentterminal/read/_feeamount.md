{% tab title="Step by step" %}
**Returns the fee amount based on the provided amount for the specified project.**

#### Definition

```solidity
function _feeAmount(uint256 _amount, uint256 _feeDiscount) private view returns (uint256) { ... }
```

* Arguments:
  * `_amount` is the amount that the fee is based on, as a fixed point number with the same amount of decimals as this terminal.
  * `_feeDiscount` is the percentage discount that should be applied out of the max amount, out of MAX_FEE_DISCOUNT.
* The view function is private to this contract.
* The view function does not alter state on the blockchain.
* The function returns the amount of the fee, as a fixed point number with the same amount of decimals as this terminal.

#### Body

1.  Calculate the discounted fee by subtracting the discount from the fee.

    ```solidity
    // Calculate the discounted fee.
    uint256 _discountedFee = fee - PRBMath.mulDiv(fee, _feeDiscount, JBConstants.MAX_FEE_DISCOUNT);
    ```

    _Libraries used:_

    * [`PRBMath`](https://github.com/hifi-finance/prb-math/blob/main/contracts/PRBMath.sol)
      * `.mulDiv(...)`
    * [`JBConstants`](../../../../libraries/jbconstants.md)
      * `.MAX_FEE_DISCOUNT`
2.  Return the amount of tokens from the specified amount that should be paid as a fee.

    ```solidity
    // The amount of tokens from the `_amount` to pay as a fee.
    return
      _amount - PRBMath.mulDiv(_amount, JBConstants.MAX_FEE, _discountedFee + JBConstants.MAX_FEE);
    ```
