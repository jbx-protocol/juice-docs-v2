# Definition

```solidity
function _beforeTransferTo(address, uint256) internal override { ...}
```

* Arguments:
  * `_to` is the address to which the transfer is going.
  * `_amount` is the amount of the transfer, as a fixed point number with the same number of decimals as this terminal.
* The resulting function is internal to this contract and its inheriters.

#### Body

1.  Before transferring tokens to another address, approve that address to pull the specified amount of tokens from this contract.

    ```solidity
    IERC20(token).approve(_to, _amount);
    ```
