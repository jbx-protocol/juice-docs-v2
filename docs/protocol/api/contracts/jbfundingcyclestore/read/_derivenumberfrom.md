**The number of the next funding cycle given the specified funding cycle.**

### Definition

```solidity
function _deriveNumberFrom(JBFundingCycle memory _baseFundingCycle, uint256 _start)
  private
  pure
  returns (uint256) { ... }
```

* Arguments:
  * `_baseFundingCycle` is the [`JBFundingCycle`](../../../data-structures/jbfundingcycle.md) to base the calculation on.
  * `_start` is the start time of the funding cycle to derive a number for.
* The view function is private to this contract.
* The view function does not alter state on the blockchain.
* The function returns the funding cycle number.

### Body

1.  If the base funding cycle doesn't have a duration, the next number is 1 more than the base's number.

    ```solidity
    // A subsequent cycle to one with a duration of 0 should be the next number.
    if (_baseFundingCycle.duration == 0) return _baseFundingCycle.number + 1;
    ```
2.  Get a reference to how long after the base funding cycle's start the specified start time is. 

    ```solidity
    // The difference between the start of the base funding cycle and the proposed start.
    uint256 _startDistance = _start - _baseFundingCycle.start;
    ```
3.  Return the number of base cycles that fit in the base distance.

    ```solidity
    // Find the number of base cycles that fit in the start distance.
    return _baseFundingCycle.number + (_startDistance / _baseFundingCycle.duration);
    ```
{% endtab %}
