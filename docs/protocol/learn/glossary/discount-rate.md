# Discount rate

#### What everyone needs to know

* A discount rate is a percentage configured on each funding cycle that determines by how much the subsequent cycle's `weight` should decrease compared to the funding cycle for which the discount rate is set.
* A discount rate is only applied if a new `weight` isn't explicitly set in a funding cycle reconfiguration.
* A discount rate can be used to create auto-decreasing token issuance over time. Funding cycles with higher `discountRate`s and/or shorter `duration`s will have token issuance decrease faster than those with smaller `discountRate`s and/or longer `duration`s.

#### What you'll want to know if you're building

* A discount rate can be specified in a funding cycle through the [`JBController.launchProjectFor(...)`](../../api/contracts/or-controllers/jbcontroller/write/launchprojectfor.md) or [`JBController.reconfigureFundingCyclesOf(...)`](../../api/contracts/or-controllers/jbcontroller/write/reconfigurefundingcyclesof.md) transactions.
