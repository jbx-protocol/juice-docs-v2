# Project

#### What everyone needs to know

* Each project within the Juicebox protocol is represented as an ERC-721 NFT.
* Whoever is the owner of a project's NFT has access to [admin functionality](/protocol/learn/glossary/operator.md) for that project within the protocol, which ultimately gives it control over the project's funds.

#### What you'll want to know if you're building

* Projects can be created either within the context of Juicebox with a call to [`JBController.launchProjectFor(...)`](/protocol/api/contracts/or-controllers/jbcontroller/write/launchprojectfor.md) which also configures its funding cycle properties and sets it up to receive payments, or by itself with a call to [`JBProjects.createFor(...)`](/protocol/api/contracts/jbprojects/write/createfor.md). The `launchProjectFor(...)` transaction calls `createFor(...)` as part of its routine.
* A project can accomodate arbitrary metadata for any number of domains that can be updated by the project owner at any time using the [`JBProject.setMetadataOf(...)`](/protocol/api/contracts/jbprojects/write/setmetadataof.md) transaction. This can be used by clients to store a reference to metadata stored on IPFS (or anywhere else). The protocol does not define standards for this metadata. A project's current metadata for any particular domain can be found by reading from [`JBProject.metadataContentOf(...)`](/protocol/api/contracts/jbprojects/properties/metadatacontentof.md).
* Look through the [`JBProjects`](/protocol/api/contracts/jbprojects/) contract for a complete list of relevant read functions, write functions, and emitted events.
