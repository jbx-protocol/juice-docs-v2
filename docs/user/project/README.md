# Project Creation Guide

The Juicebox protocol is a framework for funding and operating projects openly on Ethereum. Its contracts allow communities to receive funds, issue tokens for community membership, and configure funding cycles to transparently utilize those funds—all in powerful, customizable ways.

To create a Juicebox Project, press 'connect' in the top right corner of the [homepage](https://juicebox.money) to connect your wallet. Next, click on 'Design your Project'. Configure your project on the left side of the project design wizard. The right side shows a project preview.

The NFT which represents your project will be minted to your wallet once you create your project. You can send this NFT to a multisig or another address if you would like to transfer your project's ownership.

:::tip
Consider creating a test project on the [Rinkeby testnet version of Juicebox](https://rinkeby.juicebox.money) before creating a mainnet project. If you need help deciding how to configure your project, ask in the [Juicebox DAO Discord](https://discord.gg/juicebox).
