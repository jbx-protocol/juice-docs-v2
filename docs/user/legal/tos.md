You should not act or refrain from acting based on any information gleaned from any documents, comments, or instructions. The DAO does not endorse or make any representation as to the capabilities of any legal or tax professional or advisors within our Discord (or the Internet) and the provision of contact information is not a recommendation that you hire any such person. Please check with your legal and tax advisors to make the best decisions for your specific circumstances.

### Risks Involved in the Use of the Smart Contracts

The DAO protocol runs entirely on publicly accessible smart contracts explained in detail throughout the DAO's online documents. The DAO's protocol is public infrastructure running well-known code, all consequences from interacting with networks running the protocol are borne by the entities who sign each transaction. The protocol works according to the specifications outlined in these docs to the extent the code is written and deployed correctly, which is a collective responsibility and not guaranteed. There are major risks that this is not the case. Please do your own research.

### Source Code Repositories

No Warranties. The DAO's Repository is only a presentation of information regarding certain technologies. The statements contained in the Repository do not provide any advice, representation, warranty, certification, guarantee or promise relating to these technologies, any uses thereof or any of the other matters discussed in the Repository, nor does the Repository provide an offer or agreement to make such technologies available, maintain or update such technologies, or sell or buy any asset or enter into any transaction. You should not rely on the Repository as a basis for making any financial or other decision.

### The Decentralized Application

The DAO provides access to a decentralized finance application (“Application”) on the Ethereum blockchain that allows individuals to received Ethereum assets including Ethereum, ERC-20, ERC-721 (“Cryptocurrency Assets”) and how users receive such Cryptocurrency Assets as contributions. The Application may be configured as to emit project tokens ("Project Tokens") which may or may not have utility. The Application spans a front-end application, middleware (including Interplanetary File System metadata, Graph indexers, Cloud Functions, etc.) and an array of Ethereum smart contracts - the user at all times is required to authorize the execution of the Smart Contracts when interacting with their wallet. These collected Cryptocurrency Assets are received by projects created on the DAO Application with the support of the Smart Contracts, projects are created and managed by specific Users (“Managers”) which the DAO has no management relationship or control, but instead completely configured and managed by the Managers. The DAO Application and Smart Contracts provide Managers with tools by which to configure how the Project receive Cryptocurrency Assets, disperses said Cryptocurrency Assets and the emission rate of the Project Tokens. The DAO Application provides for complete trust-less transparent views into the Project Tokens', Managers' and Cryptocurrency Assets' life cycle, including the Project Tokens' possible redemption.

Using the DAO protocol may require that you pay a fee, such as gas charges on the Ethereum network, to perform a transaction. You acknowledge and agree that the DAO has no control over any transactions among Users over the DAO’s protocol, the method of payment of any such transactions or any actual payments of such transactions. Accordingly, you must ensure that you have a sufficient balance of the applicable cryptocurrency tokens stored at your DAO protocol-compatible wallet address (“Cryptocurrency Wallet”) to complete any such transaction on the the DAO protocol or the Ethereum network before initiating such transaction.

The DAO Application and the DAO Protocol emits Project Tokens to Managers and users for any contributions to the DAO Application directly. The DAO Protocol by default emits Project Tokens to Managers' Applications at a rate of 2.5% of all funds transferred from the Application to the Cryptocurrency Wallets in the configuration. See the Guiding Principals of Juicebox DAO for specific information regarding the terms of Membership.

### Manager Obligations

DUE TO THE NATURE OF A MANAGER’S ACTIVITIES ON THE SITE, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT MANAGERS WILL NEED TO COMPLY WITH THE INVESTMENT ADVISERS ACT OF 1940 (“ADVISERS ACT”). IT IS THE OBLIGATION OF THE MANAGER TO MAKE THIS DETERMINATION ON ITS OWN AND TAKE APPROPRIATE ACTIONS TO COMPLY WITH THE ADVISERS ACT IF AND AS NECESSARY.

THE CREATION OF THE DAO APPLICATION OF CRYPTOCURRENCY ASSETS MAY SUBJECT THE MANAGER AND PROJECT APPLICATION TO REGISTRATION REQUIREMENTS UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933 (“SECURITIES ACT”) AND THE INVESTMENT COMPANY ACT OF 1940 (“INVESTMENT COMPANY ACT”) . IT IS THE OBLIGATION OF THE MANAGER TO MAKE THIS DETERMINATION ON ITS OWN AND TAKE APPROPRIATE ACTIONS TO COMPLY WITH THE SECURITIES ACT AND INVESTMENT COMPANY ACT IF AND AS NECESSARY.

### The Verbose Privacy Policy

Certain areas of the Site or Application including any and all interactions with the Ethereum blockchain, record your Cryptocurrency address and details of the transactions you authorize. You understand that in the aggregate of transactions, including parties you transact with, specific Cryptocurrency Assets you hold, including unique ENS Domain NFTs, third party NFTs (such as a pixelized image of an anthropomorphic banana), the Cryptocurrency address, metadata associated with any Smart Contract such as the executing function, its arguments (or parameters) will contain in aggregate information which _may_ identify you personally.

The Ethereum blockchain transactions are not temporary or transient, but offensively permanently, permission-less, accessible and the DAO, the DAO's Application, contributors, affiliates are not engaged in profiling activities whatsoever. However, _any other_ 3rd party, including government agencies and foreign adversaries, will have unfettered access to all your transactions on the blockchain forever.

Your authorization of transactions with your Cryptocurrency address, using Cryptocurrency Tokens, will result in the indelible dissemination of information to the Ethereum blockchain. Notwithstanding, the Application, handles as little personal information as possible, only your Cryptographic address.

Additionally, the Application employs Fathom Analytics for website traffic analytics, which doesn't use cookies and complies with the GDPR, ePrivacy (including PECR), COPPA and CCPA. The decision to use this privacy-friendly analytics software, was in large part to ensure your IP address is only briefly processed by this 3rd party, and the DAO and the Application have no way of identifying you (aside from the aforementioned indelible entire history of Cryptographic transcations). As per the CCPA, your personal information is de-identified.

The purpose of the DAO using Fathom Analytics is to understand the Application website traffic in the most privacy-friendly way possible so that the DAO can continually improve the Application. The lawful basis as per the GDPR is "Article 6(1)(f); where our legitimate interests are to improve our website and business continually." Additionally, the DAO and its contributors, have no interest in collecting this information.

### Disclaimers; Limitation of Liability

YOU EXPRESSLY AGREE THAT ACCESS TO AND USE OF THE SITE IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK AND IS PROVIDED ON AN “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE” BASIS WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, WARRANTIES OF TITLE OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE (EXCEPT ONLY TO THE EXTENT PROHIBITED UNDER THE LAWS APPLICABLE TO TERMS OF SERVICE WITH ANY LEGALLY REQUIRED WARRANTY PERIOD TO THE SHORTER OF THIRTY DAYS FROM FIRST USE OR THE MINIMUM PERIOD REQUIRED). WITHOUT LIMITING THE FOREGOING, NEITHER THE DAO NOR ITS AFFILIATES OR SUBSIDIARIES, OR ANY OF THEIR DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES, CONTRACTORS, AGENTS, ATTORNEYS, THIRD-PARTY PROVIDERS, DISTRIBUTORS, LICENSEES, LICENSORS, SUCCESSORS OR ASSIGNS (COLLECTIVELY, “DAO PARTIES”) WARRANT THAT THE SITE WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED, BUG-FREE OR ERROR-FREE, AND NONE OF THE COMPANY PARTIES WARRANT THAT SMART CONTRACTS ARE MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR ANY PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND/OR RECOGNIZED BY ANY PARTICULAR JURISDICTION(S).

TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, THE DISCLAIMERS OF LIABILITY CONTAINED HEREIN APPLY TO ANY AND ALL DAMAGES, LOSSES AND/OR INJURY WHATSOEVER CAUSED BY OR RELATED TO USE OF, OR INABILITY TO USE, THE SERVICES UNDER ANY CAUSE OR ACTION WHATSOEVER OF ANY JURISDICTION, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ACTIONS FOR BREACH OF WARRANTY, BREACH OF CONTRACT AND/OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE). THE DAO PARTIES SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, PUNITIVE AND/OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES IN ANY WAY WHATSOEVER ARISING OUT OF THE USE OF, OR INABILITY TO USE, THE SITE.

IN THE EVENT THAT A COURT AND/OR ARBITRATOR(S) OF COMPETENT JURISDICTION HOLDS THAT ANY DAO PARTY IS LIABLE TO YOU (FOR EXAMPLE AND WITHOUT LIMITATION, BECAUSE ANY RELEASE OR WAIVER HEREUNDER IS FOUND TO BE VOID OR OTHERWISE UNENFORCEABLE, OR BECAUSE ANY CLAIMS ARE FOUND TO BE OUTSIDE THE SCOPE OF ANY SUCH RELEASE OR WAIVER), UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES WILL ANY OF THE DAO PARTIES BE LIABLE TO YOU IN THE AGGREGATE FOR MORE THAN THE AMOUNT YOU HAVE PAID THE **DAO DIRECTLY OR THE PERCENTAGE OF THE PROTOCOL FEE PAID TO THE DAO ARISING FROM YOUR CONTRIBUTION TO A PROJECT** IN THE THIRTY (30) DAYS IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING THE DATE ON WHICH YOU FIRST ASSERT ANY SUCH CLAIM, WHETHER SUCH LIABILITY IS BASED ON BREACH OF WARRANTY, BREACH OF CONTRACT OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE.

_As scoped, the extent of liability is bound to any payments made to the DAO or the percentage of the Member project contribution which the DAO received within the thirty (30) preceding days. i.e. On a contribution of 1 ETH (1 ETH/\$1000.00) to the DAO directly, the liability cap would be \$1,000,00 or 1 ETH, so long as the contribution occurred within the prior thirty (30) days. Alternatively, a contribution to a project with the same amount above, 1 ETH, so long as the funds were transferred from the Application to the Project's external Cryptographic address, and in doing so, incurred the DAO protocol fee of 2.5%, the DAO's liability cap would be \$25.00, so long as the aforementioned transfer occurred within the prior thirty (30) days._

You agree to defend, indemnify and hold harmless the DAO, its members, affiliates, contributors, service providers, and their respective officers, directors, employees, contractors, agents, licensors, suppliers, successors and assigns from and against any claims, liabilities, damages, judgments, awards, losses, costs, expenses or fees (including reasonable attorneys' fees) arising out of or relating to your violation of these Terms or the failure to fulfill any obligations relating to the use of the Site incurred by you or any other person or entity using your account. We reserve the right to take over the exclusive defense of any claim for which we are entitled to indemnification under these Terms. In such event, you shall provide us with such cooperation as is reasonably requested by us, including, without limitation, disclosure of documents and providing testimony.

### Arbitration

**Informal Negotiations.** To expedite resolution and control the cost of any dispute, controversy or claim arising under or related to your account, the the DAO protocol or Application, the Site, these Terms, or any other transaction involving you and the DAO, whether in contract, warranty, misrepresentation, fraud, tort, intentional tort, statute, regulation, ordinance, or any other legal or equitable basis (or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity thereof) (“Dispute”), you and the DAO agree to first attempt to negotiate any Dispute (except those Disputes expressly provided below) informally for at least ninety (90) days before initiating any arbitration. Such informal negotiations commence upon written notice from one person to the other. You should send your notice to the general Discord channel for https://juicebox.money or via https://chat.blockscan.com/ to the Gnosis multi-signature address 0xAF28bcB48C40dBC86f52D459A6562F658fc94B1e ("Notice Address"). The DAO will send its notice to you by the Discord handle provided by you in connection with the aforementioned notice or to the Cryptographic address used in connection with the Application via the aforementioned https://chat.blockscan.com/.

**Binding Arbitration.** If you and the DAO are unable to resolve a Dispute through informal negotiations, either you or the DAO may elect to have the Dispute (except those Disputes expressly excluded below) finally and exclusively resolved by confidential binding arbitration, and not in a class, representative or consolidated action or proceeding. In such event, these Terms memorialize a transaction in interstate commerce; (i) the Federal Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C. § 1, et seq.) governs the interpretation and enforcement of this Section; and (ii) this Section shall survive termination of these Terms.

Any election to arbitrate by one party shall be final and binding on the other, and your grounds for appeal are limited. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT ABSENT THIS PROVISION, YOU WOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A JURY TRIAL. The arbitrator may award you the same damages and relief as a court sitting in proper jurisdiction could, and may award declaratory or injunctive relief. In addition, in some instances, the costs of arbitration could exceed the costs of litigation and the right to discovery may be more limited in arbitration than in court. The arbitration shall be commenced and conducted under the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) and, where appropriate, the AAA’s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (“AAA Consumer Rules”), both of which are available at the AAA website. The determination of whether a Dispute is subject to arbitration shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act. The parties agree that the arbitrator shall have exclusive authority to decide all issues relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability and scope of this arbitration agreement. Your arbitration fees and your share of arbitrator compensation shall be governed by the AAA Rules and, where appropriate, limited by the AAA Consumer Rules. If such costs are determined by the arbitrator to be excessive, you will pay all arbitration fees and expenses. The arbitration may be conducted, at the option of the claimant, either in person or by video conference. The arbitrator will make a decision in writing, but need not provide a statement of reasons unless requested by a party. The arbitrator must follow applicable law, and any award may be challenged within a reasonable period of time (not to exceed 30 days) if the arbitrator fails to do so. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, you and the DAO may litigate in court to compel arbitration, stay proceedings pending arbitration or to confirm, modify, vacate or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator. Judgment upon any award rendered by the arbitrator(s) may be entered and enforcement obtained thereon in any court having jurisdiction. All arbitration proceedings shall be closed to the public and confidential and all records relating thereto shall be permanently sealed, except as necessary to obtain court confirmation of the arbitration award. Each party shall have the right to participate by video conference in order to minimize travel and expense burdens. Subject to the terms and conditions of these Terms, the arbitrator shall have authority to grant any form of appropriate relief, whether legal or equitable in nature, including specific performance.

**Restrictions/No Class Actions.** You and the DAO agree that any claim brought in connection with a Dispute, whether resolved through arbitration or not, will be brought between the DAO and you individually, and that you may not assert any such claim against the DAO as plaintiff or class member in any purported class or representative proceeding. To the fullest extent permitted by law, (1) no arbitration shall be joined with any other; (2) no Dispute between you and the DAO is to be arbitrated on a class-action basis or will utilize class action procedures; and (3) you may not bring any Dispute in a purported representative capacity on behalf of the general public, other Users of the Site or any other persons. If this specific provision is determined to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this Arbitration section will be null and void.

Exceptions to Informal Negotiations and Arbitration. You and the DAO agree that the following Disputes are not subject to the above provisions concerning informal negotiations and binding arbitration:

(1) any Disputes seeking to enforce or protect, or concerning the validity of, any of your or the DAO’s intellectual property rights; and (2) any claim for injunctive relief.

Effect of Changes on Arbitration. Notwithstanding the provisions of these Terms, if the DAO changes any of the terms of this Arbitration section after the date you first accepted these Terms (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Terms), you may reject any such change by sending us written notice (including by electronic mail to the aforementioned Notice Address via https://chat.blockscan.com/) within 30 days of the date such change became effective, as indicated in the “Last Updated” date above or in the date of the DAO’s email to you notifying you of such change (whichever is earlier). By rejecting any change, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any Dispute between you and the DAO in accordance with the terms of this Arbitration section as of the date you first accepted these Terms (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Terms.

**Small Claims Court.** Notwithstanding the foregoing, you may bring an individual action in the small claims court of your state or municipality if the action is within that court’s jurisdiction and is pending only in that court.

### Governing Law

These Terms and all aspects of your use of the Site shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the internal laws of the United States and the State of Delaware governing contracts entered into and to be fully performed in Delaware (i.e., without regard to conflict of law’s provisions) regardless of your location except that the Arbitration section above shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act. For the purpose of any judicial proceeding to enforce an arbitration award or incidental to such arbitration or to compel arbitration, or if for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration, you hereby submit to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the state and Federal courts sitting in San Francisco, California, and agree that service of process in such arbitration or court proceedings shall be satisfactorily made upon a party if sent by certified, express or registered mail addressed to it at the address set forth in the books and records of the DAO, or if no such address has been provided, by email to the email address, or by notice via Discord, or by the aforementioned chat to the Notice Address provided by the relevant party to the DAO in connection with its use of the Site. With respect to any Disputes not subject to informal dispute resolution or arbitration (as set forth above), you agree not to commence or prosecute any action in connection therewith other than in the state and Federal courts located in San Francisco, California, and you hereby consent to, and waive all defenses of lack of personal jurisdiction and forum non conveniens with respect to, venue and jurisdiction in the state and Federal courts located in San Francisco, California. To the extent non-U.S. laws mandate a different approach with respect to governing law, venue, statute of limitation, and dispute resolution method with respect to certain non-U.S. persons, each such required standard shall be applied, but all other provisions under this section shall remain in full force.

### General

If any clause or part of any clause of these Terms is found to be void, unenforceable or invalid, then it will be severed from these Terms, leaving the remainder in full force and effect, provided that the severance has not altered the basic nature of these Terms.

No single or partial exercise, or failure or delay in exercising any right, power or remedy by us shall constitute a waiver by us of, or impair or preclude any further exercise of, that or any right, power or remedy arising under these terms and conditions or otherwise.

If any of the provisions in these Terms are found to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable by any court of competent jurisdiction, the remainder shall continue in full force and effect.

The DAO shall not be liable for any unforeseeable event beyond its reasonable control not caused by its fault or negligence (each, a “force majeure event”), which causes the DAO to be unable to perform its obligations under these Terms, and which it has been unable to overcome by the exercise of its due diligence, provided that the DAO shall use reasonable efforts to avoid or remove such causes of nonperformance, shall suspend performance only for such period of time as is necessary as a result of such force majeure event and shall resume performance as quickly as reasonably possible.
All disclaimers, indemnities and exclusions in these Terms shall survive termination of the Terms and shall continue to apply during any suspension or any period during which the Site is not available for you to use for any reason whatsoever.

These Terms and the documents referred to in them set out the entire agreement between you and us with respect to your use of the Site, the DAO and the services provided via the Site and supersede any and all prior or contemporaneous representations, communications or agreements (written or oral) made between you or us.
