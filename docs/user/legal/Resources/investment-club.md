SUBSCRIPTION AGREEMENT
This Subscription Agreement (this “Agreement”) is entered into by and between [LLC / Series Name ] (the “Vehicle”), [a Delaware Limited Liability Company / a Series of [Master LLC Name], a Delaware Limited Liability Company (the “Master LLC”)], and the undersigned party as Subscriber (the “Subscriber”), effective as of the date set forth on the Acceptance of Subscription page of this Agreement. Capitalized words that are used but not defined in this Agreement have the meaning given them in the Limited Liability Company Agreement of the [Vehicle / Master LLC, together with each applicable Series Addenda for the Vehicle ] (as amended, restated, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time, the “Operating Agreement”). In consideration of the mutual covenants set forth in this Agreement and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the Subscriber and the Vehicle hereby agree as follows:

1. Subscription.
   (a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Subscriber hereby irrevocably tenders this subscription (this “Subscription”) for an interest in the Vehicle (an “Interest”) in the amount set forth on the “Subscription Amount” line (the “Subscription Amount”) on the Subscriber’s applicable signature page hereto (the “Signature Page”).
   (b) This Subscription, when and if accepted by the Administrative Member of the Vehicle, will constitute a commitment to contribute to the Vehicle that portion of the Subscription Amount accepted by the Administrative Member. The Subscriber will be admitted as a Member in the Vehicle at the time this Subscription is accepted by the Administrative Member pursuant to the terms of Section1(c) below, and the Subscriber hereby irrevocably agrees to be bound by the Operating Agreement as a Member of the Vehicle and to perform all obligations contained in the Operating Agreement applicable to him or her, including making contributions to the Vehicle.

   (c) The Administrative Member, on behalf of the Vehicle, may accept or reject this Subscription, in whole or in part, in its sole discretion.

At the Closing, the Administrative Member will execute the Acceptance of Subscription and deliver notice of the Closing to the Subscriber within a reasonable time after the Closing. Upon acceptance, the Subscriber will be issued the Interest for which it has subscribed. Failure to deliver fully-completed and executed Subscription Documents, of which this Agreement is a part, may result in the Vehicle rejecting this Subscription.
   (d) The Vehicle has the unrestricted right to condition its acceptance of the Subscriber’s Subscription, in whole or in part, upon the receipt by the Vehicle of any additional instruments (including any designations, representations, warranties, or covenants), documentation and information requested by the Vehicle in its sole discretion, including an opinion of counsel to the Subscriber, evidencing the legality of an investment in the Vehicle by the Subscriber and the authority of the person executing this Agreement on behalf of the Subscriber (collectively the “Additional Documents”), in addition to these Subscription Documents.
   (e) The Subscriber understands that the Vehicle has entered into or expects to enter into separate subscription agreements with other members which are or will be substantially similar in all material respects to this Agreement providing for the admission of such other members as Members in the Vehicle. This Agreement and other separate subscription agreements are separate agreements and the sale arrangements between the Vehicle and other members are separate sales. The Subscriber also acknowledges and agrees that the Administrative Member may enter into side letters with certain Members (which may include the Subscriber) which contain terms different from those in this Agreement or amend and supplement certain provisions of the Operating Agreement as it applies to such Members. In the event of any inconsistency between the terms of this Agreement and the terms of any side letter, the terms of the side letter shall control.

   (j) Neither this Subscription nor any of the Subscriber’s Capital Contributions do or will directly or indirectly contravene applicable laws and regulations, including anti-money-laundering laws and regulations.

In furtherance of those efforts, the Subscriber hereby represents, covenants, and agrees that, to the best of the Subscriber’s knowledge based on reasonable investigation:
   (i) None of the Subscriber’s Capital Contributions to the Vehicle (whether payable in cash or otherwise) will be derived from money laundering or similar activities deemed illegal under federal laws and regulations.

When requested by the Administrative Member, the Subscriber will provide any and all additional information, and the Subscriber understands and agrees that the Administrative Member may release confidential information about the Subscriber or persons related to Subscriber if the Administrative Member has determined that the release is necessary to ensure compliance with all applicable laws and regulations concerning money laundering and similar activities.

   (i) a Prohibited Investor;
   (ii) a Senior Foreign Political Figure, any member of a Senior Foreign Political Figure’s “immediate family,” which includes the figure’s parents, siblings, spouse, children and in-laws, or any Close Associate of a Senior Foreign Political Figure, or a person or entity resident in, or organized or chartered under, the laws of a Non-Cooperative Jurisdiction;
   (iii) a person or entity resident in, or organized or chartered under, the laws of a jurisdiction that has been designated by the U.S. Secretary of the Treasury under Section 311 or 312 of the USA PATRIOT Act as warranting special measures due to money laundering concerns; or

The Subscriber hereby agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Vehicle and each member thereof from and against any and all losses, damages, expenses, liabilities or reasonable attorneys’ fees (including attorneys’ fees and expenses incurred in a securities or other action in which no judgment in favor of the Subscriber is rendered) due to or arising out of a breach of any representation or warranty of the Subscriber, whether contained in the Operating Agreement, this Subscription Agreement or the Subscription Documents.

   (n) The Subscriber understands the risks involved with acquiring an interest in the Vehicle, understands the business of the Vehicle, has thoroughly read and understands all the provisions of the Operating Agreement and can withstand a total loss of its Capital Contributions to the Vehicle.
   (o) [The Subscriber understands that the use of a limited liability company with protected or registered Series (a “Series LLC”) has not yet been widely adopted and is subject to various legal uncertainties, including, without limitation, uncertainties relating to:
   (i) the potential non-recognition of the separate and segregated assets and liabilities of a Series in jurisdictions that do not have statutes permitting the establishment of a Series LLC;
   (ii) the risk of non-compliance with statutory requirements that must be met in order to maintain the separate liability and assets of a Series in Delaware or any applicable state even if that state otherwise recognizes or permits the establishment of a Series LLC;
   (iii) the novelty and lack of established precedent regarding Series LLCs and the potential for liability “spill-over” risks between a Series and the Series LLC or another Series;

The Subscriber understands that the Vehicle and the Administrative Member expect to deliver tax return information, including Schedule K-1s (each, a “K-1”) to the Subscriber by either electronic mail, a posting to a Subscriber-accessible platform, or some other form of electronic delivery. Pursuant to IRS Rev. Proc. 2012-17 (Feb. 13, 2012), the Subscriber hereby expressly understands, consents to, and acknowledges such electronic delivery of tax returns and related information. Federal law prohibits the Vehicle, the Administrative Member, or their affiliates and designees from disclosing, without consent, subscriber’s tax return information to third parties or use of that information for purposes other than the preparation of subscriber’s tax return. As part of subscription to this offering, the Vehicle, the Administrative Member, or their designees may disclose subscriber’s income tax return information to certain other affiliated entities or third-party service providers for tax return preparation and data aggregation purposes. The Vehicle and its designees covenant they will keep and maintain subscriber’s information in strict confidence, using such degree of care as is appropriate to avoid unauthorized access, use or disclosure, and will not use such information in violation of law. In executing this Agreement, subscriber authorizes the Vehicle or the Administrative Member to disclose tax return information to various service providers, their respective successors, affiliates and, or such other third-party service providers as subscriber may request or as may be required by the Vehicle or the Administrative Member for purposes of completing tax return preparation and K-1 delivery pursuant to this agreement.
    (a) The Subscriber’s consent to electronic delivery will apply to all future K-1s unless such consent is withdrawn by the Subscriber.
    (b) If for any reason the Subscriber would like a paper copy of the K-1 after the Subscriber has consented to electronic delivery, the Subscriber may submit a request to the Administrative Member. Requesting a paper copy of the Subscriber’s K-1 will not be treated as a withdrawal of consent.
    (c) If the Subscriber in the future determines that it no longer consents to electronic delivery, the Subscriber will need to notify the Vehicle so that it can arrange for a paper K-1 to be delivered to the address that the Vehicle then currently has on file. The Subscriber may submit notice to the Administrative Member. The Subscriber’s consent is considered withdrawn on the date the Vehicle receives the written request to withdraw consent. The Vehicle will confirm the withdrawal and its effective date in writing. A withdrawal of consent does not apply to a K-1 that was emailed to the Subscriber before the effective date of the withdrawal of consent.
    (d) The Vehicle (or the Administrative Member) will cease providing statements to the Subscriber electronically if the Subscriber provides notice to withdraw consent, if the Subscriber ceases to be a Member of the Vehicle, or if regulations change to prohibit the form of delivery.
    (e) If the Subscriber needs to update the Subscriber’s contact information that is on file, please email the update to the Administrative Member. The Subscriber will be notified if there are any changes to the contact information of the Vehicle.
    (f) The Subscriber’s K-1 may be required to be printed and attached to a federal, state, or local income tax return.
22. Elections and Audits. The Subscriber covenants and agrees to take any action reasonably requested by the Vehicle in connection with an election by the Vehicle under Section 6221(b) or 6226 of the Code or an audit or a final adjustment of the Vehicle by a taxing authority (including, without limitation, promptly filing amended tax returns and promptly paying any related taxes, including penalties and interest). Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Subscriber covenants and agrees, if applicable, to take into account and report to the IRS any adjustment to its items for any reviewed year as notified to them by the Vehicle in a statement, in the manner provided in Section 6226(b), whether or not such Subscriber owns any Interests in the Vehicle in the year of the Vehicle’s statement. Any Subscriber that fails to report its share of such adjustments on its U.S. tax return for its taxable year including the date of the Vehicle’s statement as described immediately above shall indemnify and hold harmless the Vehicle, the Administrative Member, and each of their Affiliates from and against any and all liabilities related to taxes (including penalties and interest) imposed on the Vehicle as a result of the Subscriber’s inaction.
