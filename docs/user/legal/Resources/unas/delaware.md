## Article I - Organization

### Section 1.1 Status.

[INSERT NAME HERE] DAO (the "DAO") is a "nonprofit association" under the Delaware Uniform Unincorporated Nonprofit Association Act, Del. Code Ann. Tit. 6, §§ 1901-1916. The DAO is not intended to be, and shall not be deemed to be, a partnership.

### Section 1.2 Purposes.

**The DAO is organized to carry out the missions stated in its membership portal (available at https://juicebox.money/@projectname), related websites or otherwise memorialized in a writing by the DAO. The DAO is not intended to be or become an entity required to register as an “investment company” as defined in Section3(a)(1)(A) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.**

### Section 1.3 Nondiscrimination.

The DAO shall not arbitrarily discriminate on the basis of race, nationality, religion, age, gender, sexual orientation, disability, political affiliation, or otherwise.

### Section 1.4 Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO).

The DAO is an unincorporated association of individuals, corporations, statutory trusts, business trusts, estates, trusts, partnerships, limited liability companies, associations, joint ventures, or any other legal or commercial entity, many, if not all, of whom agree to join together for a common, nonprofit purpose. For the DAO, that purpose is encapsulated in its mission statement.

## Article II - Membership

### Section 2.1 Eligibility.

Membership in the DAO, as defined in Del. Code Ann. Tit. 6, § 1901, shall be voluntary and open to any individual whose purpose or presumed intent is to contribute to the DAO and is willing to accept the responsibilities and terms of membership.

### Section 2.2 Admission.

The DAO is a decentralized network of members and may admit or deny individuals for any arbitrary purpose or lack of purpose.

**All of the DAO governing members shall have their membership determined upon receipt of voting tokens secured on a public blockchain (“Cryptographic Units”, and such holders, “Members”). Cryptographic Units are used for participating in and improving the governance of the DAO through affirmative votes effectuated via the Designated Smart Contract (defined herein) (such process, “Cryptographic Consensus”). Once the DAO admission requirements are met a prospective Member may be put up to a vote of the full membership or similar process enabled by the Designated Smart Contract. The DAO will consistently review, and if necessary, Members may make adjustments to the DAO admission requirements based on their evolving needs and as registered in a successful vote through the Designated Smart Contract.**

### Section 2.3 Rights.

**The DAO's Members shall utilize the “Designated Smart Contract” (a smart contract deployed to the Designated Blockchain at the Designated BlockchainAddress) as the exclusive method of holding, allocating rights and obligations among the Members, and spending, or otherwise distributing any Tokens that are DAO Property, of minting and issuing Cryptographic Units and holding and recording votes among the Members. The DAO may also utilize the Designated Smart Contract to administer and facilitate certain other arrangements and transactions involving the DAO, the Members and/or third parties.**

Members’ rights and responsibilities are controlled by the use of the Designated Smart Contract used to conduct the governance and activities of the DAO. Members will cast votes and carry out the decisions made on the Designated Smart Contract. Cryptographic Units are held in AccountAddresses, i.e., key-paired wallets controlled by Members in a designated hexadecimal address (“Member Web3 Account”).

### Section 2.4 Responsibilities.

Each Member shall keep reasonably current in payment of any dues or membership fees and other financial obligations of membership, if applicable and determined by the DAO. Each Member shall notify the DAO of an e-mail address or other acceptable communication channel by which such Member may receive written or electronic materials required or permitted by this document or shall notify the DAO that such Member has no e-mail address and designate a mutually acceptable form of communication.

If you have received any Cryptographic Units or are otherwise a Member, you consent and agree to become legally bound by this Agreement as both a participant in the DAO and more specifically a "DAO Member".

### Section2.5 Limitations.

Status as a DAO Member does not(and shall not be deemed to) create, and the DAO does not (and shall not be deemed to) include, any authority, right or power on the part of a DAO Member to act as the agent, representative or attorney of or otherwise act on behalf of the DAO or any other Member, to bind the DAO or any other Member to any Contract or Liability or to convey any DAO Property or any asset, right or property owned or held by or on behalf of the DAO or any Member. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, no Member shall be deemed the partner of the DAO or any other Member solely in virtue of being a Member. No Member shall state, purport, imply, hold out or represent to any person that such Member or any other Member has any such authority, right or power.
To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, no Member shall be (or shall be deemed to be) liable for any liability of the DAO or any other Member. This shall not (and shall not be deemed to) create or imply any obligation of the DAO or any Member to indemnify or compensate any Member from, or hold any Member harmless against, any Liabilities incurred by such DAO Member under any applicable law, in connection with the Member's participation in the DAO or otherwise.

### Section 2.6 Inactive Status.

A Member who falls from good standing may have their membership revoked or suspended through a Guild Kick. References herein to the rights and entitlements of Members shall be understood to refer only to Members in good standing.

### Section2.7 Access to Information.

Members shall have access to information concerning operational and financial affairs via the DAO's preferred treasury application. Currently the DAO treasury can be viewed via Designated Smart Contract.

### Section 2.8 Settlement of Disputes.

In any dispute between the DAO and any of its Members or former Members which cannot be resolved through informal negotiation, it shall be the policy of the DAO to prefer the use of mediation whereby an impartial mediator may facilitate negotiations between the parties and assist them in developing a mutually acceptable settlement. Neither party with a grievance against the other shall have recourse to litigation until the matter is submitted to mediation and attempted to be resolved in good faith. All Members agree that there is a preference to settle disputes amongst Members or between Members and the DAO via decentralized dispute mechanisms in smart contract protocols.

### Section2.9 Transferability of Membership.

Membership rights and interests may not be transferred except by an affirmative majority vote of Members. Any attempted transfer contrary to this section shall be wholly void and shall confer no rights on the intended transferee and shall be cause (though none is needed) to burn the Cryptographic Units through a Guild Kick member removal procedure.

### Section 2.10 Withdrawal and Expulsion.

A Member may withdraw at any time upon notice to the DAO by electronic writing to an appointed representative of the DAO or by public display to the DAO’s online coordination systems (including, but not limited to, Discord or Telegram). Withdrawal shall be effectuated through the Member burning their Cryptographic Units, a vote to burn such withdrawing DAO Member's Cryptographic Units, or mechanisms otherwise authorized in the Designated Smart Contract. Any such withdrawal request will not be unreasonably denied and shall be deemed conclusively as the DAO Member’s intent to withdraw from the DAO. A Member may be expelled by the DAO through the Guild Kick procedure established in paragraph 2.6 of this document and adopted by the membership. Upon termination of membership, all rights and interests in the DAO shall cease except for rights to redemption of capital pursuant to Article V below (if any).

### Article III - Meetings of Members

### Section3.1 Meetings.

### Section 3.2 Special Meetings.

Special meetings of members may be called by a group (the "DAO Advisory Group") designated by an affirmative vote of DAO Members in accordance with the governance procedures of the Designated Smart Contract. The DAO Advisory Group is not required and may never be formed. Creation and designation of the DAO Advisory Group will be approved via the Designated Smart Contract.

### Section 3.3 Time and Place.

The date, time and place of all meetings of the DAO Advisory Group shall be determined by the DAO Advisory Group or, in the event that the DAO Advisory Group fails to act, by a call for vote by the Members to be approved by the native governance processes to the Designated Smart Contract.

### Section 3.4 Notice.

Each Member is responsible for monitoring votes of concern on the Designated Smart Contract. Notice of votes can be set up by DAO Members via the Designated Smart Contract. Notices of meetings shall also be posted on the DAO’s official media outlets, including the DAO Member information roster, but the inadvertent failure to do so shall not affect the validity of the meeting. Any business conducted at a meeting of DAO Members other than that specified in the notice of the meeting shall be of an advisory nature only.

## Article IV - Decentralized Governance

### Section 4.1 Powers and Duties.

### Section 5.3 Communication by Electronic Means.

Unless otherwise required by law or by agreement, any notice, vote, consent, petition, or other oral or written communication required or permitted can be delivered by electronic means, provided that, in the case where such communication expressly or impliedly requires the signature of the person submitting the communication, means are in place to reasonably assure the authenticity of the signature.

### Section 6.3 Amendment.

This TUNAA may be amended by presenting the redlined version of the amendments at a meeting of members, and adopted by a vote or merge request as recorded by Cryptographic Consensus.
