## Terminology

Throughout this Legal Reference section there will be a number of terms used to described the activity in which a Juicebox treasury is used. The inherent benefits of programmable money via the blockchain lend themselves to forming, immutable rules and processes for routing, retention, payouts as well as governing how contributors participate. The Juicebox treasury lifecycle is dynamic and scalable, that is to say, the Juicebox treasury easily can manage individual proceeds resulting from the sale of NFTs to sustaining and coordinating tens of thousands of individuals.

At this point, it is assumed you generally understand that the Juicebox treasury is a tool which manages the inflow of Ethereum through a decentralized application (web page hosted on IPFS among other hosting providers) by which the persistent information is stored on Ethereum on smart contracts, both operate in concert to perform the following public good:

-   enable anyone to easily set up a payment channel to receive payments
-   public, censorship resistent transparent treasury balance, governance, and spending
-   payout scheduler, also referred to as a funding cycle, releases funds to a previously agreed upon schedule
-   mechanism to issue tokens to project contributors
-   mechansim to offer redemption of said tokens against the treasury's overflow balance (the previous statements are in no way implying any profit or revenue)

The distinction of _what type of Ethereum the treasury receives_ will be discussed in following sections, however what is pertinent

This mechanism of managing Ethereum and your project tokens is referred to as a Juicebox project but may also be called treasury, dao, shared wallet, for the purpose of this Legal Resources we will call this component of the DApp the Juicebox treasury or treasury for short. Additionally, in the reference legal documents, we call the entity Treasury for consistency.
